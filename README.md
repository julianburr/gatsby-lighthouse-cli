Run lighthouse on your gatsby app locally. Inspired by [https://github.com/ivanoats/gatsby-lighthouse](https://github.com/ivanoats/gatsby-lighthouse).

## How to use it

```bash
yarn add gatsby-lighthouse-cli --dev
```

It exposes the functionality through a binary, which you can call e.g. in your package json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lighthouse": "gatsby-lighthouse --performance=100 --accessibility=100"
  }
}
```
